Your job is to write a simple password validation function, as seen on many websites.

The rules for a valid password are as follows:

There needs to be at least 1 uppercase letter.


There needs to be at least 1 lowercase letter.


There needs to be at least 1 number.


The password needs to be at least 8 characters long.


Your function takes a string argument and returns whether it is a valid password, as a boolean.

Examples:
"Abcd1234" ===> true


"Abcd123" ===> false


"abcd1234" ===> false


"AbcdefGhijKlmnopQRsTuvwxyZ1234567890" ===> true


"ABCD1234" ===> false
"Ab1!@#$%^&*()-_+={}[]|\:;?/>.<," ===> true;
"!@#$%^&*()-_+={}[]|\:;?/>.<," ===> false;
